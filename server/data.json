		"description": "The PFC1500 is an excellent low cost solution for low amperage charging that comes in a sealed enclosure. Being one of the more versatile chargers by being able to accept both 110v and 220v, the PFC1500 is a great low to mid range charger. These chargers are voltage specific, so we have to program the charge curves before delivery.",

		"description": "The LG Chem battery modules have excellent stability based on the proprietary separator technology. With the lightweight pouch design it makes it easy to change the designs according to customers' requirements. Each module is arranged in a 16s configuration providing 2.6kWh and rated at 200-400 amp continuos with 800amp max discharge. Due to the power density and high discharge rate these modules are a perfect fit for the Tesla Model S drive unit. A preferred configuration for a typical Model S drive unit is 2p6s for a total of 32kWh, However you can add modules in a 1p6s configuration for an additional 16kW per group.",
